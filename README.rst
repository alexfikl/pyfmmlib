pyfmmlib
========

pyfmmlib is a Python wrapper for `fmmlib2d
<https://cims.nyu.edu/cmcl/fmm2dlib/fmm2dlib.html>`_ and `fmmlib3d
<https://cims.nyu.edu/cmcl/fmm3dlib/fmm3dlib.html>`_ implementations of the
fast multipole method for Laplace and Helmholtz potentials by Zydrunas Gimbutas
and Leslie Greengard.

This wrapper is far from comprehensive. It just catches the things I ended up
needing. Nonetheless, the FMMs and a fair bit of other useful stuff is accessible.
